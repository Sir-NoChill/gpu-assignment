# Procedure

After you follow the [procedure](./procedure.md) for how to set up gem5 in GPU mode, you should try to run our [sanity test](./assets/TODO) to ensure that your environment is set up correctly. Read through the provided [PyTorch Code](./assets/MNIST.py) to see what exactly is happening behind the scenes in the program.

- Copy scripts/MI200/* to your favorite directory.
- Make a second copy of the directory and you may call it the MI300
- We need to make some changes to the MI200 to reflect the specification of the MI300, they are as follows:
    - TODO
- Run a simulation of the PyTorch MNIST training workload on both the MI200 and MI300 models you have created.
    - You should be able to run these simulations to completion, they should take no more than 5 minutes each to run.
